This folder contains third party packages for motion planning experiments. Specifically:

* `mav_msgs` from [ethz-asl/mav_comm](https://github.com/ethz-asl/mav_comm)
* `mav_trajectory_generation` from [ethz-asl/mav_trajectory_generation](https://github.com/ethz-asl/mav_trajectory_generation)
  - The dependencies on `yaml_cpp_catkin` and `nlopt` are removed.
* `rpg_common` and `rpg_common_ros`: generally useful utility code
* `rpg_vi_utils`: utility code and data structure that are useful for quickly prototyping visual-inertial fusion
